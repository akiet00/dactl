The work and opinions expressed here are solely belong to my personal experience.
{: .notice}
## Main Responsibilities
At Minnetronix, I was mainly responsible for 3 main tasks: 1. Designed and drafted mechanical drawings for medical device enclosures 2. Attended customer calls 3. Learned about the daily routine of a mechanical engineer working in biomedical industry.

## My reflection of my first internship
Given that in a person's undergrad career, we only have roughly 4 chances of holding an internship, I thought it's worthwhile to reflect on each experience as we finished them.

## Accomplishment
* Get a feel for what it's like workin in biomedical inldustry as a mechanical engineer <br>
* First internship experience <br>
*  Do I like working in biomedical industry? or aerospace? or mechatronics? or combination
